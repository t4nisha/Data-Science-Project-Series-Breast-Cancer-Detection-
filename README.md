Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the diagnosis of breast cancer as malignant or benign based on features extracted from medical images. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer more accurately and efficiently.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as malignant or benign. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1.Preprocess the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2.Identify relevant features for breast cancer prediction and perform feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.
3.Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for binary classification of breast tumors.
4.Train and evaluate the SVM model on the preprocessed dataset to assess its predictive performance.
5.Provide insights and recommendations based on the model's findings to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

Approach:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of features.
2. Feature Selection and Engineering:
Identify relevant features for breast cancer prediction using statistical analysis and domain knowledge.
Create new features or transformations that might enhance the predictive model's performance, such as feature scaling or dimensionality reduction techniques.
3. Machine Learning Model (SVM):
Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for binary classification of breast tumors.
Tune hyperparameters and optimize the SVM model to achieve the best performance.
4.Evaluation:
Train the SVM model on a portion of the dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.
